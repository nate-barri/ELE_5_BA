Linear Regression,6.316129766312932,8.63014831513413,0.1154827412482508,1.1262276974597973,True,Linear Model,Interpretable coefficients; fast training; stable predictions; works well with scaled features,Primary model when demand follows linear trends and for easy business interpretation,1
Random Forest,7.122003830829579,269.8610418194338,0.13025959142215637,4.736375376766098,False,Tree-Based Ensemble,Reduces variance through bagging; less prone to overfitting; handles missing data well,Reliable baseline for diverse product categories with varying demand patterns,2
Ensemble (Average),7.970624677630824,183.5461390425867,0.1457508914033535,5.751725192264358,False,Model Ensemble,Combines strengths of all models; reduces prediction variance; more robust to data shifts,Best overall approach when no single model consistently outperforms; reduces risk,3
Enhanced XGBoost,10.93980853578596,276.0361499068798,0.20003498223561597,11.96951708550741,False,Tree-Based Ensemble,Handles non-linear relationships; robust to outliers; regularization prevents overfitting,Best for complex demand patterns with interactions between features,4
